# Visualization-Walmart-Trip-Type-Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying customer trips into different trip types based on transactional data. By segmenting store visits, Walmart aims to enhance customer experiences and optimize store operations. The classification is performed using machine learning techniques on a dataset of purchased items.

## Objective
- Analyze customer transactions and segment them into predefined trip types.
- Develop machine learning models to classify trips based on purchased items.
- Improve the accuracy of trip type classification using feature engineering and advanced modeling techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of transactional data capturing:
- Unique trip identifiers
- Purchased item details (category, department, etc.)
- Purchase quantities and prices
- Trip type labels (target variable)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- XGBoost & Random Forest (Modeling)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized data distributions and trip type frequencies.
   - Identified correlations between purchased items and trip types.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Transformed categorical features into numerical representations.
   - Engineered new features to enhance model performance.

3. **Modeling & Evaluation:**
   - Built classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
   - Used cross-validation to ensure model generalization.
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Optimized hyperparameters to improve classification accuracy.

## Results
- The best-performing model achieved **X% accuracy** in classifying customer trips.
- Feature importance analysis showed that **top features** played a significant role in trip classification.

## Future Work
- Experiment with deep learning approaches for trip classification.
- Incorporate external data sources for better feature engineering.
- Deploy the model as an API for real-time classification.
